    <p>Three, it's a <input type="text"> number</p>
    <p>Yes it is, it's a magic number</p>
    <p>Because two <input type="text"> three is six</p>
    <p>And three times six is eighteen</p>
    <p>And the <input type="text"> letter in the alphabet is <input type="text"></p>
    <p>We've got three R's we're going to talk about today</p>
    <p>We've got to learn to <input type="text">, Reuse, Recycle</p>
    <p>Reduce, Reuse, <input type="text"></p>
    <p>Reduce, <input type="text">, Recycle</p>
    <p>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</p>
    <p>If you're going to the market to buy some <input type="text"></p>
    <p>You've got to bring your own <input type="text"></p>
    <p>and you learn to reduce your <input type="text"></p>
    <p>And if your brother or your sister's got some <input type="text"> clothes</p>
    <p>You could <input type="text"> them on before you buy some more of those</p>
    <p>Reuse, we've got to learn to reuse</p>
    <p>And if the first two R's don't <input type="text"> out</p>
    <p>And if you've got to make some <input type="text"></p>
    <p>Don't <input type="text"> it out</p>
    <p>Recycle, we've got to learn to recycle,</p>
    <p>We've got to learn to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</p>
    <p>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</p>
    <p>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</p>
    <p>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</p>
    <p>Because three it's a magic number</p>
    <p>Yes it is, it's a magic number</p>
